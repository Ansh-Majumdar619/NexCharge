# NexCharge

NexCharge is an innovative and comprehensive platform designed to revolutionize the way electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are managed and accessed. As the world rapidly embraces sustainable transportation, NexCharge empowers EV owners, charging station operators, and administrators with a seamless, intuitive, and secure solution to monitor, control, and optimize the electric charging ecosystem.

## Project Overview

At its core, NexCharge offers a robust full-stack application that bridges the gap between EV drivers seeking reliable charging points and operators striving to maintain an efficient charging infrastructure. The platform combines cutting-edge technologies including React for a dynamic user interface, Express.js for a scalable API, MongoDB for flexible data storage, and JWT for secure user authentication.

## Key Features

- **Secure User Authentication & Authorization:**  
  NexCharge provides a safe and smooth signup/login experience. Users’ credentials are securely hashed, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) ensure protected access to sensitive operations.

- **Dynamic Charger Management:**  
  Registered users can add new chargers, update existing ones, or remove outdated stations. Each charger entry stores essential details such as precise geographical location (latitude & longitude), operational status (Active/Inactive), power output ratings, and connector types—ensuring accurate and reliable data.

- **Real-Time Charger Visibility:**  
  The platform aggregates and presents all chargers, enabling users to effortlessly discover available charging points tailored to their needs. This feature improves accessibility and planning for EV journeys.

- **Robust RESTful API:**  
  Built on Express.js and MongoDB, the backend ensures high performance and reliability for data handling, while also being scalable to accommodate future enhancements and integrations.

- **Role-Based Access Control:**  
  Sensitive actions such as creating, updating, or deleting charger data are protected behind authentication, ensuring only authorized personnel can make modifications, thereby maintaining data integrity.
